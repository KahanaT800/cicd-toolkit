# üìã EasyDeploy Script Cheat Sheet

Every utility script lives in `scripts/` and is grouped by responsibility. Start with the menu, then drop down to the specific command you need.

## üéØ Start Here

```bash
./scripts/easydeploy.sh
```

The menu is interactive and also accepts direct subcommands:

```bash
./scripts/easydeploy.sh beginner      # üî∞ Guided onboarding
./scripts/easydeploy.sh install       # ‚ö° Quick installation
./scripts/easydeploy.sh deploy        # üöÄ Deployment control panel
./scripts/easydeploy.sh status        # üìä Status dashboard
./scripts/easydeploy.sh troubleshoot  # üõ†Ô∏è Conflict management
```

> ‚úÖ Remember one command and you can reach every other feature.

## üöÄ Common Workflows

### First-time experience
```bash
./scripts/easydeploy.sh beginner
# or run the script directly:
./scripts/init/beginner-setup.sh
```

### Install for an existing project
```bash
./scripts/init/install.sh --type auto
# Follow the prompts to select project type and environments
```

### Day-to-day deployments
```bash
git commit -m "[deploy] Fix payment bug"
git push
# or trigger manually:
./scripts/deploy/auto-deploy.sh interactive
```

### Status & troubleshooting
```bash
./scripts/deploy/status.sh status            # Quick health check
./scripts/deploy/troubleshoot.sh detect      # Detect conflicting workflows
./scripts/deploy/troubleshoot.sh interactive # Guided conflict resolution
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Always start with `./scripts/easydeploy.sh`** ‚Äì the menu remembers every option for you.  
2. **Keep configuration files under `config/`** ‚Äì commit updates to `config/universal_config.json` or `config/auto_cicd_config.json` to make pipelines reproducible.  
3. **Mix CLI and CI triggers** ‚Äì `auto-deploy.sh` supports commit, branch, API, and manual triggers, so you can integrate with existing release flows.  
4. **Run diagnostics early** ‚Äì `environment-setup.sh`, `github-auth.sh`, and `status.sh` surface environment issues before they block a release.
